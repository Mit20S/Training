1.  How to add events to html elements at runtime  using javascript?
---- The addEventListener() is an inbuilt function in JavaScript which takes the event to listen for, and a second argument to be called whenever the described event gets fired. Any number of event handlers can be added to a single element without overwriting existing event handlers.
Syntax: element.addEventListener(event, listener, useCapture);
