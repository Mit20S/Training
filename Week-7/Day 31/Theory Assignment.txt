2. How to use *ngIf in Angular?
Answer: A shorthand form of the directive, *ngIf="condition", is generally used, provided as an attribute of the anchor element for the inserted template.
        Angular expands this into a more explicit version, in which the anchor element is contained in an <ng-template> element.
        
        Ex:  <div *ngIf="condition">Content to render when condition is true.</div>
        
3. How to hide a html element using Angular ?
Answer: The ng-hide directive hides the HTML element if the expression evaluates to true.

        Ex:  Hide HTML: <input type="checkbox" ng-model="myVar">
            <div ng-hide="myVar">
            <h1>Welcome</h1>
            <p>Welcome to my home.</p>
            </div>

5. What  is interface in TypeScript? Why do we use?
Answer: An interface defines the syntax that any entity must adhere to.
Interfaces define properties, methods, and events, which are the members of the interface.
Interfaces contain only the declaration of the members. It is the responsibility of the deriving class to define the members.
Syntax - 
interface interface_name 
{ 
}

interface IPerson { 
   firstName:string, 
   lastName:string, 
   sayHi: ()=>string 
} 

var customer:IPerson = { 
   firstName:"Tom",
   lastName:"Hanks", 
   sayHi: ():string =>{return "Hi there"} 
}
