2. How to hide the elements using Bootstrap?
Visually hide an element while still allowing it to be exposed to assistive technologies (such as screen readers) with .visually-hidden. Use .visually-hidden-focusable to visually hide an element by default, but to display it when it’s focused (e.g. by a keyboard-only user). .visually-hidden-focusable can also be applied to a container–thanks to :focus-within, the container will be displayed when any child element of the container receives focus.
