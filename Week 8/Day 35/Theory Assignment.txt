1. What is MVC and MVVM?

2.  What are keys in React JS? How involve keys in array processing in React?
Answer: Keys help React identify which elements have been changed, added, or removed throughout each render.
        Keys should be given to the elements inside the array to give the elements a stable identity:
     
        const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
        const listItems = numbers.map((number) =>
        <li key={number.toString()}>
        {number}
        </li>
        );
     
        The best way to pick a key is to use a string that uniquely identifies a list item among its siblings. 
        Most often you would use IDs from your data as keys.
